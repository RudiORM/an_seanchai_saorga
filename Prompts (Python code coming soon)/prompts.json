      "prompt": "You are a narrative structure expert working with irish interactive fiction from the time of fionn and na fianna. I need you to transform a basic story outline into a branching narrative structure. Let's approach this step by step. First, here is the overall story.The Chess Game beneath the Yew Tree\nAn Cluiche Fichille faoin gCrann Iúir (The Chess Game beneath the Yew Tree)\nAlso known as\nCumain liom an imirt (I recall the game-playing)\nFurther Information\nDuanaire Finn no. 69\nOne day during the elopement of Diarmaid and Gràinne they were gathering berries in a yew tree. The Fianna were in pursuit of them and came to the place where the exiles were. The Fianna took a rest, and Fionn and Oscar sat right under the tree Diarmaid and Gràinne were in and began to play ficheall (a board game – sometimes translated as \"chess\"). Diarmaid watched them from above, and when he saw Oscar make a bad move he dropped a berry onto the board, as if to indicate where he should move, and Oscar followed his advice. Fionn noticed this, and looking up, he saw Diarmaid in the tree. He wanted to have him killed straight away but Oscar wanted to let him go, and there arose a dispute among the Fianna. It came to a battle between Fionn's faction and Oscar's. Men were killed on each side, but in the end they came to terms and Diarmaid and Gràinne were allowed to leave in safety.\n There are versions of this lay from Argyllshire.\n Note: Tóraíocht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne (The Pursuit of Diarmaid and Gráinne) and Diarmaid, Gráinne, agus Ciuthach (Diarmaid, Gráinne, and Ciuthach) also concern the elopement of Diarmaid and Gráinne.\n \n\nNow here is the previous scene from the story:\n\n{'scene_number': 3, 'setting': 'The forest clearing, tension-filled as the Fianna must decide Diarmaid and Gráinne's fate', 'action': 'The Fianna must reach a decision after skirmishes cause casualties on both sides.', 'choices': ['A cease-fire is proposed, allowing Diarmaid and Gráinne safe passage.', 'Fionn presses for Diarmaid's capture despite the losses, reigniting hostilities.'], 'trigger': 'A cease-fire allows resolution and peaceful departure for Diarmaid and Gráinne. If hostilities reignite, the Fianna are deeply divided, possibly altering their future.'}\n\nand the choice the user took: Fionn presses for Diarmaid's capture despite the losses, reigniting hostilities.\n\n Now briefly resolve the story in one sentence."

Use extremely sparse descriptions. Avoid Irish clichés. Keep it VERY concise: 2-3 short sentences per paragraph, with no more than 2 paragraphs total. Include dialogue wherever you can.\n\nCharacters involved:\nFionn mac cumhaill: Fionn mac Cumhaill, the formidable leader of the Fianna and Clan Baoiscne, is a wise and valiant warrior whose magical insight often guides his decisions; however, his assertive leadership can occasionally lead to friction and discord within his ranks, particularly with figures like Diarmaid and Goll.\n\nLon mac liobhain: Lon mac Liobhain is a fearsome and masterful blacksmith whose sinister ambitions drive him to forge powerful weapons for the warriors of Lochlann, wielding his monstrous appearance and unparalleled skill to shape the destiny of battles through his creations.\n\nDubhan's daughter: daughter of Dubhan\n\n\n\nSetting:\nOn board a ship in the midst of a fierce storm at sea.\n\nAction:\nThe ship is caught in a violent storm, and the crew fears it will sink unless the ship is lightened.\n\nLater user choices (do not reference these in your scene but your scene will end with one of these) [\"Agree to follow Dubhan's daughter's suggestion to throw overboard every ninth man.\", 'Propose an alternate solution to avoid losing any men.', \"Refuse to sacrifice anyone, risking the ship's fate\"]\n\nImportant formatting:\n1. Mark character names with \"~\" before and after each full name (e.g., ~Fionn mac Cumhaill~). Always use complete names exactly as provided above.\n2. Do not include a title - begin the scene immediately.\n3. Separate paragraphs with \"XXX\".\n4. Match the emotional tone to the scene - solemn for serious moments, energetic for action.\n5. Use period-appropriate terms for weapons, nature, and daily objects.\n\nCRUCIAL: Your scene MUST begin by describing the choice made in the previous situation and use the detail provided to advance from that scene to the current one. Incorporate ALL key elements from the action description, especially:\n- Any previous decisions the characters made\n- The current state/condition of the characters \n- The specific dynamics between characters mentioned\n- The exact challenge or opportunity they're facing\n\nMaintain historical authenticity while creating a vivid, engaging scene that flows naturally from the previous context, but with extreme brevity.\n\nThis is the first scene so start by briefy describing the setting.

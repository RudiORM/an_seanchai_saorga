They take Fionn there, but just as the Gray Dog is about to kill him, Fionn takes out Bran’s chain. At once the dog fawns over him and starts to lick his wounds – he was in fact Bran’s brother, whom the Lochlannaich (Scandinavians) had stolen when he was a puppy. Fionn is then taken in – either by an elderly couple who live nearby, or by the Gray Dog’s master – and his wounds are healed. He blows his horn, the Dòrd Fèinne, to summon the Fianna.

The father reluctantly agrees to let the boy do so, provided he return within the space of six years (or six months in some tellings). On their way to Connacht, the Fianna come across a group of wild swine and proceed to kill them all, save for one, which escapes after the boy cuts off its tail.

Fionn notes that he cannot do so, as the Fianna are currently spread out all over Ireland. As they walk, they meet a number of young men, who possess abilities which prove useful to Fionn – amongst them are one whose whistle can be heard all around Ireland, turn a small stick into the largest of ships, carry the weight of any boat, intuitively guide a ship to any port in the world, and another who could find out anything in the world that Fionn wants to know. Joining them were also a young man who could scale any structure no matter how tall or steep, and a master thief, who Fionn initially refuses to let come along.\n The first boy whistles and summons the Fianna, letting them know that Fionn may be in trouble. Answering the call, they immediately come from all over Ireland. The second boy is then given a small stick, which he turns into a great ship. Using the rest of their abilities, the ship is put in the water and the Fianna and their new assistants successfully travel over to England. When they arrive, they are given a great welcome and informed that a giant who has already abducted two children, has now threatened to take the king’s son. The Fianna surround his cradle and stand watch. Despite their best efforts, the giant succeeds in taking the child, but not before having his arm torn off. The young man with endless knowledge discerns that the giant lives in the Eastern World and has taken the children there. Fionn, the Fianna and the young men then set out on a recovery mission.\n\nThe climber and the master thief eventually succeed in rescuing all three without the giant initially noticing. As their ship departs, the giant flies into a rage and chases them. Despite his best attempts to sink the ship, he is ultimately defeated and they continue on, reaching England by sunrise the next morning. The king is overjoyed with the return of the children, and throws a feast in honour of Fionn, the Fianna and the young men. Upon their departure for Ireland, he fills their boat with silver and gold. Despite Fionn’s insistence, the young men take none of the treasure, and assure Fionn that whenever he needs them, they will be there.",

They eventually see a light, which turns out to be a small dwelling. Upon entering, they find a feeble old man sitting by the fire, who invites them to stay the night. While the Fianna are talking amongst themselves, an agitated young ram storms around the house. Noticing their annoyance at this, the old man says that they may tie it up if they wish. Fionn instructs Goll to do so. Despite his best efforts and multiple attempts, he is unable to get a grip on the young ram. In some tellings, other members of the Fianna also attempt to tie up the ram, to no avail. Much to their chagrin, the old man then easily completes the task himself. Fionn then takes notice of a young girl in another corner of the room. He approaches her and offers a compliment, to which she reacts negatively. She tells him that they have met before, and that he had not appreciated her beauty then. Fionn is confused and bewildered by the incident, having no recollection of a previous interaction with her. In some versions, the woman approaches each member of the Fianna, who each try (and fail) to keep her attention. The next morning as they leave, the old man informs them of the meaning of their experience. The ram is life itself, with all its trials and tribulations, and the times when they would be defeated or subdued. The young woman is youth and represents the fact that it is often not appreciated until later (in the case of the tellings in which members of the Fianna unsuccessfully try to keep her attention, she is representative of the fact that youth cannot be preserved and belongs only to time).

The Fianna inform him that Cormac mac Airt is the king of Ireland. He travels to meet Cormac, who purposely does not reveal his identity. Cormac invites Iollann to stay the night and says that the King of Ireland will fight him in the morning. Cormac then gets his men to keep Iollann awake telling stories to ensure that he has a lack of sleep the next morning. When Iollann prepares to fight Cormac the next day, Cormac tells him that Fionn mac Cumhaill is the true King of Ireland and that it is Fionn that he should be fighting. \n Iollann goes back to the Fianna and tells Fionn that he knows him to be the King of Ireland. Fionn, having heard what Cormac said, agrees that the Fianna will fight Iollann. Fionn asks Diarmaid to fight on his behalf, and when he along with Goll, Oscar, and others refuse, Fionn himself agrees to fight Iollann. During the fight Fionn begins to struggle and the Fianna step in, at which point Oscar offers to fight on Fionn’s behalf. After a day of fighting, Iollann asks Oscar for a truce for the night because he is tired due to a lack of sleep.\n To keep Iollann awake so that Oscar will be victorious, Fionn goes to Iollann’s bedside and asks him to tell stories. (This motif also appears in Meargach na Lann [Meargach of the Blades].) Iollann is sceptical that he is being kept up while Oscar rests, but Fionn assures him that Oscar and the other Fianna are drinking and telling stories of their own. Iollann tells Fionn stories of how he met his wife, how they were both abducted, how she was slain and how he brought her back to life with the help of the King of India, but how his brothers were slain in Ireland while looking for him. Fionn asks Iollann why he wishes the same fate as his brothers, at which point Iollann prepares to fight Oscar, as morning has come. A vicious fight takes place between Iollann and Oscar, and eventually, with the encouragement of the Fianna, Oscar is victorious in slaying the son of the King of Spain.\n There are variations in terms of the events in the story, with some versions stating that Fionn and Cormac cannot agree who is the true king, requiring them to seek knowledge from the oldest person alive. However, it is Oscar who beheads Iollann by the end in most versions.",

There is also a version in the form of a lay in the sixteenth-century Book of the Dean of Lismore (no. 24 in Neil Ross, Heroic Poetry from the Book of the Dean of Lismore). The Fianna do not feature in these literary versions, but they are present in some oral versions. For instance, in a version collected in Islay, Cú Chulainn is aiding the Fianna in the battle in which he kills Conlaoch. In some Irish tellings, and in a version of the story collected in the form of a lay in Caithness, Conlaoch comes to invade Ireland and defeats and binds a number of the Fianna before Cú Chulainn fights and kills him.\n As a story this has been collected in Scotland in South Uist, Islay, and Mull, and in Ireland in Counties Galway and Donegal.

This is followed by a verse saying that the lay tells a sad tale about the Fionn and Diarmaid (some versions start with this verse instead).\n Fionn requested that that Diarmaid come to Ben Gulabin (though it is sometimes localised elsewhere) to kill the terrible poisonous boar that lived there and that no weapon could harm. Diarmaid agreed to do this. The Fianna set forth and found the boar. There is a description of the boar, saying that its bristles were sharper than spears – and in some versions sharper even than the Gae Bolga, the fearsome weapon of Cù Chulainn. Diarmaid broke his spear on the boar’s hide, but eventually managed to kill it with his sword. Fionn was displeased by this, as he had hoped and expected that the boar would kill Diarmaid. He asked Diarmaid to measure the length of the boar, from snout to tail and then back again. On the second measurement, the sole of one of Diarmaid’s feet was pierced by one of the boar’s bristles. In some versions he died straight away and the lay concludes with some verses praising his beauty and nobility.\n That is the basic story, but there are versions with more information. For instance, some explain that Diarmaid had eloped with Gràinne, and that this was the reason Fionn wanted him killed, and some versions have a conversation near the start of the lay in which Gràinne warned Diarmaid not to trust Fionn. In some versions, as Diarmaid lay dying he requested that Fionn give him a drink of water as this would heal his wound. Fionn refused and Diarmaid died.\n There are versions of this lay from places in Argyllshire (including Mull, Tiree and Glenorchy), Lochalsh, Lewis, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist, Barra and Skye.\n Note: Tóraíocht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne (The Pursuit of Diarmaid and Gráinne), An Cluiche Fichille faoin gCrann Iúir (The Chess Game beneath the Yew Tree), and Diarmaid, Gráinne, agus Ciuthach (Diarmaid, Gráinne, and Ciuthach) also concern the elopement of Diarmaid and Gráinne and the death of Diarmaid.\n  ",

        "text":"The Rustic in the Drab Coat\nBodach an Chóta Lachtna (The Rustic in the Drab Coat)\nAlso known as\nFear a Chòta Liathghlais (The Man in the Grey Coat)\nA foreign warrior named Caol an Iarainn (the Slender one of Iron, simplified to Cael in some tellings) arrives in Howth. Desirous to rule Ireland, he challenges the Fianna to find someone who can vanquish him. He tells them that if any one of the Fianna can beat him in either running, wrestling, or fighting, he will return home to his own country. Fionn mac Cumhaill tells the warrior that Caoilte mac Rónáin is the fastest of the Fianna, but he is not there at present. Fionn suggests that the warrior stay and make acquaintance with the Fianna while he goes in search of Caoilte. The warrior agrees.\n On his way to Tara, where he thinks Caoilte may be, Fionn meets a poorly attired giant, known as Bodach an Chota Lachnta (the Tramp with the Grey Coat). Upon hearing the story of Caol an Iarainn, the Bodach tells Fionn that he will challenge him on behalf of the Fianna. Caol an Iarainn agrees to the challenge against the Bodach.\n In some versions the challenger is more generic, and he may even be a member of the Fianna. For instance, in an Islay version, the Bodach has worked for Fionn for a while, carrying heavy burdens others could not, and Conán challenges him to the race because he is jealous of the favour the Bodach is getting from Fionn.\n The night before the race, the Bodach builds a hut to sleep in. Caol an Iarainn refuses to assist, and he also refuses to go hunting or share a meal with the Bodach. The following morning, the day of the race, the Bodach gives Caol an Iarainn a head-start while he rests and eats. When he eventually sets off, he easily overtakes Caol an Iarainn. The Bodach then stops to eat some berries. Caol an Iarainn catches up and passes the Bodach, who easily overtakes him again when he is done picking berries.\n While the literary version depicts Fionn nervously waiting to see which of the men will win, the Fianna are absent from the conclusion of the story in most oral versions. The Bodach wins the race and being near exhaustion, prepares himself oatmeal. He is eating when an angry Caol an Iarainn finishes the race and approaches. The Bodach throws his oatmeal at him with such force that Caol an Iarainn is beheaded, or else strikes him so that his head is the wrong way around. In the case of the former, the Bodach reattaches his head, but in his haste, places it back to front. In one telling from County Clare, Conan races the Bodach instead of Caol an Iarainn, and tricks his way to victory. The decapitation plot is similarly recalled, but in reverse. Conan knocks the Bodach’s head off by throwing his oatmeal and proceeds to reattach it the wrong way. In this telling, the incident happens before the race’s conclusion and the Bodach begins running backwards, allowing the slower Conan to win.",

The king of Scandinavia (Lochlann) asked which hero bore this or that banner, and Fearghas identified them.\n\nThe general list of the heroes and their banners is as follows (NB there are minor variations in the names in some versions):\n\nDiarmaid: Liath-luaineach (liath is “grey”. The second element is obscure, possibly “restless one”)\nCaoilte: Dubh-nimhe (“the black venomous one”)\nRaoine: An Aona-Chasach Ruadh (“The red-haired one-footed one”)\nGoll: A’ Bhriochail-Bhrocail (“The ragged, tattered one” [?])\nOscar: Sguab-ghabhaidh (“The terrible sheaf”)\nFionn: An Dealbh Ghrèine, an Deò-Ghrèine, an Gath-Ghrèine, or Gile-Grèine (“Image of the Sun, the Ray of the Sun, the Ray of the Sun, the Whiteness of the Sun”)\n Additionally, one version (Reliquiae Celticae, vol.

One of his sons, often called Míogach, is spared, and he shows his gratitude by serving Fionn for a period of time (elsewhere he appears as Fionn’s foster-son, or as a young hero who volunteers to serve Fionn). Conán mac Morna warns Fionn that Míogach is dangerous, but Fionn does not listen. In some versions, at the end of Míogach’s service he is given some land.\n Years later, Fionn and the Fianna encounter Míogach, whom Fionn may not recognise at first, while hunting nearby. In some versions, Míogach recites some riddling poetry. It is often Conán who recognises him first. Míogach then invites the Fianna to a feast. Fionn instructs one or more members of the Fianna (often including Diarmaid) to stay behind, while he and the others go with Míogach. In a version from Barra, Míogach is now king of Lochlann and has invited the Fianna to feast with him after hearing that the hunting had failed in Ireland.\n The Fianna enter the dwelling and soon become alarmed when no food is provided at the supposed banquet. They then notice the dwelling changing shape. When they realise they cannot move, Fionn uses his thumb of wisdom to find out what is happening to them, often at the instigation of one of his men. Fionn realises that Míogach has an army of foreigners, kings, and warriors in his other dwelling, and that they need three kings’ blood (or that of their sons) to release them from the seats to which they are magically affixed.\n In some versions of the story, Fionn and the group of trapped Fianna sound the dórd Fiann (chant of the Fianna, otherwise a horn which Fionn blows, or a hammer he strikes), which alerts the Fianna who stayed behind. In other versions, Diarmaid (or another) goes in search of Fionn and happens to hear the dórd while out searching. There is then a battle, which the free Fianna win. They obtain the blood of the kings and use it to release Fionn and the trapped Fianna. The magical blood runs out before Conán can be released, however, and he must be pulled up by force, leaving the skin of his backside behind; this is why he is called Conán Maol (Bald Conán).

        "text":"Little Red-haired Eochaidh’s Enchanted Hall\nBruíon Eochaidh Bhig Dheirg (Little Red-haired Eochaidh’s Enchanted Hall)\nAlso known as\nFionn ann an Taigh a Bhlàir Bhuidhe (Fionn in the House of the Blàr-Buidhe)\nMembers of the Fianna are out hunting when they happen upon or are enticed into a strange dwelling. In some they are approached by Eochaidh Beag Dearg (also referred to as Eochaidh Béal Dearg or more generic descriptions) who offers the Fianna hospitality. Donegal versions closely mirror the Early Modern romance in that he offers otherworldly apples to entice them.  In a version from Lochaber, the master of the house is away when they arrive, and his wife warns them not to stay.\n After these members of the Fianna go missing, some versions have Fionn use his thumb of wisdom to see that they are in danger, and he sets off to join them, bringing along his young son and Bran. In versions from Argyllshire, when Fionn goes to look for them, he tells his men that “no man born in Ireland” (meaning any man at all) may follow him; Fergus follows him, however, as he was born in Jura, not Ireland.\n More and more otherworldly guests arrive at the dwelling, some of whom challenge the Fianna. In most versions, Conán, who is on door duty, clashes with a large fairy woman – she beats him in the first bout and he then beats her, as he was never any good until he had first been cast down – and she promises that if he spares her life, she will aid the Fianna in some way.\n A fairy warrior then arrives with a black hound. (Material from Laoidh a’ Choin Duibh - The Lay of the Black Dog - is generally incorporated here.) The black hound kills Conán’s hound and all the rest of the Fianna’s hounds, and Bran is also succumbing until Conán uncovers his venomous claw. Bran kills the black hound and Conán kills its owner.\n In some versions, another fairy warrior then arrives with a boar that Eochaidh Beag Dearg has sent for their supper. It runs off, and Conán threatens to kill the warrior who brought it. The warrior then presents the roasted boar to Conán on a spit, and Conán gives the first quarter of meat to Fionn, the second to the Fianna, the third to Bran, and keeps the final quarter for himself.\n A different fairy warrior may also appear carrying a trough of water for the Fianna to wash their hands after dinner. Conán is the first to go to wash, but is warned by Fionn not to act too quickly. Conán places his small toe into the trough and it is burnt to the bone. He then throws the soldier into the trough, turning him to ashes. Conán throws the water at the fairies and those it touches turn to ashes.\n The tale ends with a battle in which Fionn summons the absent Fianna -- often with the dord Féinne, a horn which the Fianna can hear when he blows it, however far away they are – and they defeat the otherworldly forces. In the County Clare version, the fairy woman whose life Conán spared earlier is responsible for alerting the rest of the Fianna.",

As the time approaches, the elderly Cormac anticipates his death and defeat at the hands of the Fianna, and marries the daughter of a local blacksmith. As predicted, he is killed in the battle and Conn goes on to assume the high kingship. However, Cormac’s young widow gives birth to a son shortly after the king is killed. After his birth, the young boy is taken by a wolf and raised in the woods alongside its cubs. His only identifying feature is a belt which was left for him by his late father and placed upon him by his mother after his birth. He is eventually taken back to society by hunters and raised by a nobleman. When he is old enough to read the inscription on his belt, he returns to find his birth mother. It is clear that while Cormac’s Kingship had been marked by widespread prosperity and comfort, Conn’s reign is defined by drought and famine.

He asks them if they are going to reap the harvest, which they inform him they are. He then asks if they prefer to reap or tie the hay. Not taking the question seriously, they reply that they prefer tying. He informs them that he will reap the hay, and they can bind it. He proceeds to reap the corn so fast that the Fianna end up killing one another trying to keep up the pace, until there is no one left. Dubbed “Cath na bPunann” (The Battle of the Sheaves), it is said to have been the most intense “battle” that the Fianna were ever engaged in.\n In Scottish versions, “Cath na bPunann” refers more literally to a battle in which the Fianna, while gathering the harvest, engage a group of raiding Lochlannaich (Norseman) in battle on the beach in Tiree. They did not have their weapons to hand, so they sent Caoilte, the fastest runner in the Fianna, to fetch them. In the meantime they fought the Lochlannaich with the sheaves they had reaped, and when Caoilte arrived with the weapons they slaughtered them all.\n This story was collected in counties Galway and Kerry in Ireland and Tiree and Mull in Scotland.\n  ",

In some versions she is headless, in others she has an animal’s head, and in still others she is simply said to be very ugly. She asks several of the Fianna for hospitality, but all reject her apart from Oisean\/Oisín (or Diarmaid in some tellings). He gives her food and agrees to let her stay the night, and that night they sleep together. In the morning he finds that she has become a very beautiful woman. She informs him that she is the daughter of a king, and makes a stunning castle appear in the surrounding landscape. Oisean\/Oisín then asks her to marry him, and she obliges. A similar transformation can be seen in the medieval Irish saga Echtra Mac nEchach, as well as in international folk tales (ATU D732). In some versions there is a battle among the Fianna to see who should get to marry this beautiful woman, which ends when Fionn says that she should decide whom to marry, and she chooses Oisean\/Oisín. In other versions it is Oscar or Diarmaid, rather than Oisean\/Oisín, although there are no major deviations in the ensuing plot.\n She tells him that she will stay with him as long as he never reminds her of the state she was in when she arrived. However, she later angers him by giving away puppies he was rearing to various members of the Fianna, and on each occasion, he reminds her of the state she was in when they first met. After the third instance, she disappears along with the castle.

Some versions start with a debate between Patrick and Oisean, after which Oisean tells Patrick the following story.\n The Fianna were out hunting when they saw a large fleet coming ashore. The fleet was led by Magnus, King of Scandinavia (Lochlann) (or the son of the King of Lochlann), who demanded Fionn’s wife and Bran, his hound, as tribute. Fionn refused this, and there was a fight between the two men (or between the two armies). Fionn won, but rather than killing Magnus he offered him the choice of returning home or staying a year with the Fianna, which is what he choose. There was peace between the two forces. In some versions, Magnus made a second attempt after a while, but was again defeated by the Fianna.\n Some versions include a section on the banners of the Fianna (see Bratach Fhinn \/ Bratach Fhinn). There are versions from Lewis, South Uist, Barra, Tiree and Caithness.\n  ",

        "text":"Maol of the House of Manannán’s Invitation to Fionn\nCuireadh Mhaoil uí Mhananáin ar Fhionn (Maol of the House of Manannán’s Invitation to Fionn)\nThe story begins after a day’s hunt, when Fionn and the Fianna are relaxing, playing a game of dice or cards. They are suddenly approached by a small bald man (fear maol). In the Cork version, it is also noted that he is a magician with no ears. The fear maol engages Fionn in conversation. Some elements of the literary version are preserved in their dialogue, including a lingering suspicion about the fear maol’s wife’s infidelity. In boasting about his possessions, he eventually informs Fionn that he has a sow and piglets. Following the general premise of the literary tale, he invites the Fianna for a meal, adding that they can eat one of the pigs. Unbeknownst to Fionn, he has sneakily placed him under a geis whereby he can’t turn down the invitation. He then takes off, leaving the Fianna to hurriedly follow him back to his dwelling. It is completely dark by the time the Fianna arrive. The fear maol informs them that while he invited them to share one of his pigs, he never said that he would kill it, and thus they must perform the task. In the Kerry version, Cormac is given the duty, while in the Cork version it falls on Diarmuid. Regardless, the outcome is the same in both variations. They lay the pig out on the table and when they are prepared to give it a death blow, the scene changes in the blink of an eye. In the Kerry version, the table, pig, and fear maol have all disappeared, leaving them in the empty dwelling with nothing but their dice. They then angrily (and hungrily) return home. The fear maol returns the following week and informs them that he had played a trick on them that evening, and proceeds to provide them with a fine meal. In the Cork version, the situation is never rectified. The story ends with the fear maol’s trick, which in this version finds the Fianna instantly sent back to where they were playing cards at the start of the tale.",

He tells how one day Osgar, Daorghlas, Fionn and himself were out when they saw a big, ugly man coming towards them. He had one eye and one foot. Fionn asked where he was from and the man replied that his name was Lon Mac Liobhain, and that he was the smith of the king of Scandinavia (Lochlann), in Bergen. He put a geas on Fionn, saying that they must all now follow him to his smithy. He went ahead of them, and they ran after. Lon ran unnaturally fast and it was hard for them to keep up with him, but Daorghlas was very fast and followed him closely. When they reached the smithy Daorghlas went inside and started to work in it. The other smiths asked “Who is this slender (caol) man with no (timeadh) fear\/heat”, and so Fionn gave him the new name Caoilte. (The wordplay here is clever. The question could mean either “Who is this slender, fearless man?” or “Who is this slender man who does not feel the heat (of the forge)?” Fionn combined the sounds of the words caol and timeadh to create the new name “Caoilte”.)\n Caoilte and the smiths then made excellent swords for the heroes. Fionn’s sword was called Mac an Luin. They went from there and there was a battle between the Fianna (Caoilte, Faolan, Fionn, Osgar, Goll and Oisín\/Oisean himself) against the army of the king of Scandinavia (Lochlann), which the Fianna won.\n In some versions there is an episode before the battle in which Lon says the swords must be tempered in human blood, and the lot falls to Fionn. He tricks the smith’s mother so that Lon kills her with the sword, and Fionn then kills Lon, thus tempering the blade, and so the swords are ready. At the end of the lay Oisín\/Oisean laments his old age and loneliness.\n In versions collected in Donegal, Caoilte’s original name is Delgus or Daolghas instead of Daorghlas, and it is Conan or Conn, rather than Fionn, who gives him his new name.",

In versions from County Galway and South Kerry, he asks Fionn if he may temporarily join the ranks of the Fianna as a servant, to which Fionn almost always obliges. Fionn then allows his horse to graze amongst the Fianna’s own. Being of an ill-temperament, however, the horse begins to fight with the Fianna’s horses. Conán mac Morna demands that the horse be removed. The Giolla Deacair is none too pleased with this, and refuses to remove the horse himself. As a result, the Fianna, led by Conán, attempt to gallop the horse to death. Conán is much smaller than the horse’s normal rider, so up to fifteen other members of the Fianna mount the horse and begin to apply pressure. The Giolla Deacair, disgusted by the attack on his horse, decides to leave Ireland, and when his horse sees his master leaving, it takes off after him along with Conán and the other members of the Fianna. Conán and the other men become stuck to the horse’s back and are unable to dismount, so Fionn and the other Fianna must set out to rescue them. \n The horse continues on until it reaches the sea, then proceeds to follow his master into the water. When Fionn and the Fianna reach the seashore, they come across two men who magically furnish them with a boat and offer to help track the missing horse and members of the Fianna (In some versions the two men are presented as giants). The search party eventually come upon a steep, rocky island in the middle of the sea, which is presented as ‘the Land of Promise’ or ‘Tír na nÓg’ (‘The Land of Youth’). \n Fionn and the Fianna enter the island and rescue their comrades from the Giolla Deacair, who turns out to be the island’s king and a powerful enchanter. Broadly reflecting the early modern literary version, some tellings from Connacht have Conán exact punishment upon the Giolla Deacair by insisting that he and fourteen of his men be brought to Ireland in the same manner which he and the Fianna were. The Giolla Deacair accepts this form of retribution and the Fianna await the arrival of him and his men in Ireland. When they arrive and dismount from the horse, the Giolla Deacair motions towards the meadow where the Fianna’s horses are grazing. When the Fianna look back, he and his men have disappeared.",

        "text":"The Adventure of Céadach the Great\nEachtra Chéadaigh Mhóir (The Adventure of Céadach the Great)\nThe story is centered around the rivalry between Céadach (or Ceudach) and a peer who eventually kills him. In northern and western versions, his rival is typically referred to as Lonndubh or some variation depending on the location and specific details of the story (for example ‘Lon Dubh Mac Rí Tír na Sorcha’ or ‘Lonndubh Mac Rí na bhFaoileann’). In Kerry versions, his name appears as some form of ‘Gruaig Dhearg’. Their relationship to one another also varies. While some versions depict them as step-brothers, others cast them as young apprentices, students or warriors. The basis of their feud is usually presented as a love triangle, in which the two men compete for the hand of a female character (often referred to as Scoith Shíoda). In some versions, she is referred to as the daughter of a king, while elsewhere she is the daughter of their tutor or the blacksmith for whom they are apprenticing. One common element in almost all tellings is the way in which the competition between the two is settled. The father places the men in a room and has them exit out of two separate doors. He then instructs his daughter to follow whomever she prefers. In all cases, Céadach is selected. In some western and northern versions, Céadach has a more active role in the desired outcome, as he nails a consenting Lonndubh’s finger to an anvil in the promise that should they meet in the future, Lonndubh can deliver the first blow uncontested.\n The couple departs and Céadach takes service with the Fianna. After a successful hunting trip in which he is seen to be the most accomplished of the group, they begin to fear his power and assign him a number of onerous tasks in the hope that he will be killed carrying them out. In time Fionn asks Céadach to accompany him to the Eastern World (in some versions, this trip is the result of a hag placing a geis on Fionn). While his wife (or mother in Scottish versions) initially refuses to let him go, she eventually relents with the proviso that Fionn should raise white sails on their return approach if Céadach is alive and black sails if he has perished during the journey. In some of the versions from County Kerry, she instructs Fionn to raise red sails if Céadach has died and informs him that in such a case, she will then drown herself. In other tellings, Céadach warns Fionn not to carry out the request because his wife is likely to drown them all in her moment of grief. However, in one version from County Kerry, Fionn comes to this conclusion himself through the thumb of knowledge. He also has a premonition that Céadach will be killed by his old rival, Lonndubh. In most versions, this comes to fruition, sometimes invoking the earlier ‘first blow’ aspect of the plot.\n\nThe story concludes with Céadach’s resurrection. In Munster, this is typically brought about by the Fianna, who brandish a cure from the Eastern World. In other versions, he is revived by his wife (or mother in Scottish versions). In Ulster renderings, this is achieved by mimicking the actions of a group of crows who bring one of their flock back to life with renewing water.",

He describes an instance in which, while out hunting, the Fianna come across the princess of Greece, who has been placed under a spell that gives her the appearance of a monstrous hag. She battles the Fianna and is ultimately slain.\n A slightly more detailed prose version is also found. In this version, she is the daughter of the king of the Eastern World. Shortly after her birth, an enchanter informs the king that she will one day have a son with Fionn mac Cumhaill who will grow up to kill and behead him. As she comes of age, the king sends her to collect tributes all over the world. All the while, he uses magic to give her the monstrous appearance. When she returns safe and sound, the enchanter suggests that the king send her to Ireland, as the Fianna had never allowed foreign warriors to land there without killing them. Twelve large, strong women are sent with her, and when they land in Ireland, they make their camp. Using his thumb of knowledge, Fionn learns of their location, and sees that the young woman and her aides might kill the Fianna. Some of the Fianna are sent to visit the women’s camp. Diarmaid, who has the power to make any woman fall in love with him, is instructed to win over one of the woman’s aides. While she is blinded by love, Conán hits her with a stone, killing her. The Fianna realise that the young woman will not be as easy to kill. She begins fighting with Goll. After a prolonged struggle, Goll brings her to the point of death, at which time Fionn asks for her story. As she tells him of the prophecy stating that her child with Fionn would kill and behead her father, Conán proceeds to kill her with a large stone.",

A particular emphasis is placed upon his role as a mercenary in foreign armies and his marriage to an unnamed woman of the Tuatha Dé Danann. The two soon relocate to Holland aboard the mythical boat of Manannán (rendered as ‘Marnan’ and ‘Mananámh’). After giving birth to healthy triplet boys, Crochan, Saul, and Alliun, Turlough’s wife again becomes pregnant and subsequently dies giving birth to a daughter. Turlough travels back to Ireland on the suggestion of Manannán and sends the children to be educated. Turlough brings his daughter to live in Ulster, where a cruel queen has been in the habit of cutting the left breast of every young female. Upon departing, he instructs that this is not to be done to his daughter, earning her the epithet an t-aon bhean (the only woman). Turlough leaves Ireland still in a depressed state at the loss of his wife. He meets a beggar who is similarly despondent, and the two men lay down and die together. Turlough’s three sons then win themselves renown around Ireland for acts of heroism and bravery. In the course of their travels, they are reunited with their sister and become aware of a prophecy which holds that she will ultimately bring about their demise.\n\nAt a sporting competition with the Fianna shortly thereafter, Diarmaid is afforded a kiss from his choice of any woman in attendance after he scores the first goal. He is immediately drawn to an t-aon bhean. Understanding that this is potentially a sign of the prophecy, the brothers take their sister and relocate to a remote castle. Meanwhile Diarmaid becomes infatuated by an t-aon bhean and eventually makes up his mind to go look for her. One night while the three brothers are fighting off a group of cattle raiders, Diarmaid furtively makes his way to the castle and takes their sister. When they return and see that the girl is gone, they realize that the prophecy has been fulfilled. They proceed to throw themselves off the nearest cliff.\n\nThe sole oral version of this story (delivered in English) was collected in County Clare. It bears a very close resemblance to the events described in the literary version. The inclusion of the Tuatha Dé Danann in lieu of modern-day fairies is unusual and suggests that the tale likely was not in broad oral circulation.\n  ",

Using his thumb of knowledge to sense the impending danger, Fionn and his wife devise a plan to deter the powerful enemy. Before the giant arrives at their home, Fionn’s wife has him get into the cradle and begins making cakes. Upon his arrival, she informs the giant that Fionn is out hunting, and hospitably invites him in to wait until he returns. Fionn’s wife offers him a cake which she has covertly baked the iron griddle into. She then gives a regular cake to the “baby”. The giant breaks several teeth attempting to eat the cake but is astonished to see that the child is eating it without any difficulty. When he moves closer to inspect what sort of teeth the youngster has, Fionn bites off his finger. Various other feats of strength are displayed by the “child” in different tellings. Falling for the ruse and fearing the potential size and strength of Fionn, given the power of his young “son”, the giant flees.\n\nIn one Scottish version, an Irish giant travels to Mull to challenge a Scottish giant after hearing of his strength. Like Fionn in the Irish versions, the aging giant of Mull believes that he will be outmatched and adopts the familiar plan. He remains in the cradle while his wife successfully convinces the Irish giant that he is her six-month old son.",

In some versions the lay starts with Patrick requesting the story from him.\n The Fianna have a feast at their fort, but Fionn forgets to invite the warriors from Druim Dearg, Caoilte and Ailte (in some versions Aile or Ailbhinn). They are disgruntled about this and decide to leave Ireland for a year. They go overseas and enter the service of the king of Scandinavia (Lochlann). While they are there, the queen falls in love with Ailte, and he eventually sleeps with her in the king’s bed. Caoilte, Ailte and the queen then return to Ireland together. When the king gets word of this, he goes with his fleet to attack Ireland and get his revenge on the Fianna.\n When the king arrives, Fionn to offer him compensation, but this is refused. In some versions, the verses about the banners of the Fianna are inserted here (see Bratach Fhinn). After a single combat in which the king kills Ailte, there is a long, hard fight in which Goll eventually kills and beheads him. If it is a victory, it is a sorry one, however, as half of the Fianna perish in the battle.\n This tale has been collected as a prose story in Argyllshire.

They sent Caoilte, the fastest runner of the Fianna, before them to find the road. He did not find the road, but he found a tower in which there was a fairy woman. She had weapons – a crossbow, seven swords, seven spears and seven hounds (or, according to some versions, five swords, five spears and five hounds).

Caoilte said that she would be a better partner for himself than for the giant. The giant was angry about this and told Caoilte that it was he who had killed Caoilte’s father at the Battle of Ben Cruachan (or, according to some versions from South Uist, the Battle of Ben Gulabin). They began to fight and Caoilte killed the giant, although he was also wounded badly himself. When he was lying, wounded, he heard a woman’s voice.

She introduces herself as Niamh and asks him if he will accompany her back to Tír na nÓg (the Land of Youth). Although he is initially hesitant, he eventually agrees to go. He remains with her there leading a life of comfort for what he believes has been three years, when in actuality three hundred have gone by. Feeling homesick for Ireland, he asks Niamh if he can make a brief return. She agrees and gives him her white horse for the journey. However, she gives him the strict instruction not to step foot on Irish soil, as he will be instantly transformed into an old man. When arriving in Ireland, Oisín notices the vast changes which have taken place over the past three hundred years. During his travels, he sees a group of men attempting to lift a heavy stone and offers to help. He easily lifts the stone, but as he does so, the girth of his saddle breaks, sending him tumbling to the ground. Just as Niamh had said, three centuries of aging immediately catch up with Oisín, leaving him old and decrepit. The white horse quickly hastens back to Tír na nÓg without its unfortunate rider, who remains in Ireland.\n The tale is widespread, and found in Counties Antrim, Armagh, Clare, Cork, Donegal, Dublin, Fermanagh, Galway, Kerry, Kilkenny, Laois, Limerick, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary, Waterford, Westmeath, and Wicklow in Ireland; Mull, South Uist and an unknown location in Inverness-shire in Scotland; and Maine in the United States.\n  ",

He cautiously approaches it and upon hearing noise inside, looks in only to see a group of small, naked, red-complexioned men passing around the knife to one another. In the blink of an eye, Goll is in their midst and recovers the knife. He proceeds to slay all of the men. As he makes his way through the castle, the ugliest hag he has ever seen soon appears before him. She informs him that he has killed her brothers, and that she will now kill him. She proceeds to carefully measure out lines on the floor, and informs Goll that the first one to reach each point may throw their opponent into the air. She beats him to the first two marks, and Goll is injured each time after she sends him flying. He quickly realizes that if he does not beat her to the third mark, he may be killed. He finally gets the better of the hag, and proceeds to throw her. When she lands, the impact sends her sharp teeth into her head, quickly killing her. In some tellings, Goll kills her outright using the knife rather than throwing. In all versions, Goll is overcome with exhaustion and takes time to rest.

When he does so, the little red men come out of her and begin attacking him.

Fionn sets out to greet the woman, who as it turns out, is looking for him. After a brief conversation, she challenges Fionn to a game of chess (or forfeits), to which he obliges. Fionn wins the first game. Upon winning the second game, the woman imposes on Fionn that he must be her husband until such a time as seven shovelfuls of dirt are poured over him. (In some tellings, the required number is three shovelfuls.) While he initially objects, she places a geis on him to this effect, and he soon finds himself accompanying her to her father’s kingdom.\n\nAfter they arrive, it becomes clear that she has tricked him and intends to give him as a prize to her father, who has long sought Fionn’s head. Fionn is soon captured and thrown in jail to await his imminent execution. One day, he asks the guards if they would like to hear some music from Ireland. Using his horn, the dord Féinne, he plays a tune which alerts Diarmaid that he is in trouble.\n\nDiarmaid immediately makes his way to the faraway kingdom and enquires about Fionn.

The Fianna realise that Fionn has been gone for a long time and set out looking for him.

In County Louth tellings, he is brought back to his youthful form but decides to leave his hair white. In some versions, the young woman’s actions are explained by the fact that both she and her sister are in love with Fionn.

He is approached by a half-blind, red-haired hag. She proceeds to place a geis on him to spend the night with her. She leaves shortly afterward, and from that day on he never hears from her again. Fourteen years later, a young man approaches the Fianna. He is initially perceived as a threat and has several run-ins with members of the group before he tells them about his background. He was raised by his mother in Greece but never knew the identity of his father. Growing up, he was exceptionally strong and accomplished, but ran into trouble one day when a classmate teased him about his unknown father. He hit the boy and later that night, asked his mother for the identity of his father. While she initially refused to answer, she eventually told him that it was Oisín of the Fianna in Ireland. He then set out for Ireland, with a geis upon him that he should never eat dinner on the same table three times or spend three nights in the same bed. Hearing the boy’s story, Fionn introduces him to Oisín. Observing the boy’s strength and potential, having nearly defeated Goll in one of his initial run-ins with the Fianna, Fionn welcomes him and proclaims that he is henceforth to be known as Oscar, son of Oisín. The chronology and details vary slightly in different tellings. For example, in some versions the story revolves around the son of Fionn, but follows the same general plot.",

        "text":"The Pursuit of Diarmaid and Gráinne\nTóraíocht Dhiarmada agus Ghráinne (The Pursuit of Diarmaid and Gráinne)\nAfter his wife dies, Fionn seeks the hand of the King of Ireland’s young daughter in marriage. When Gráinne sets eyes on him at their wedding banquet, she decides that she does not want to marry Fionn. In some versions of the story, she falls in love with Diarmaid Ó Duibhne due to his magical ball seirce (love spot). After she threatens to put Diarmaid under geasa, he agrees to elope with her. In some versions, Gráinne puts most of the wedding guests to sleep with a magic potion so that she and Diarmaid can escape.\n A pursuit follows in which Fionn and the Fianna track Diarmaid and Gráinne. Oral versions reference different local place names and battles during the pursuit, and elements of other stories can be found in some of the incidents that happen. Many oral versions in Ireland state that the fleeing lovers would sleep on a bag of sand when in the hills and on a bushel of heather while on the seashore to mislead Fionn’s thumb of knowledge. Some versions also refer to the couple being aided by Aengus Óg’s cloak of invisibility, which is a holdover from literary versions. Others detail Diarmuid’s attempts to ward off mercenaries that Fionn has hired to kill him. The pursuit eventually comes to an end with Aengus Óg, Diarmaid’s foster father, negotiating peace for the couple with Fionn.\n Diarmaid and Gráinne live happily until Diarmaid goes out on a chase with Fionn and the Fianna a few years later. Fionn and the Fianna are battling a boar, and although Diarmaid is told that an injunction had been put on him to never hunt swine, he says he will not avoid it even if it would bring about his death. Diarmaid encounters the boar and eventually kills it. However, he is also killed in the battle, leaving Gráinne heartbroken. Fionn can save Diarmaid by giving him some water from his hands, but he purposefully lets the water spill twice before eventually trying to save Diarmaid, when it is too late. Although some oral versions give Benbulben in Sligo as Diarmaid’s place of death, others name local areas such as Ceann Tuirc in the north west of County Cork and Ben Nevis in the north west highlands in Scotland. \n What happens after Diarmaid’s death varies. Some versions state that Gráinne spends the rest of her days alone; others state that she marries Fionn and they go on to lead an unhappy life together; while others have her killed.\n This story is widespread, with versions collected all over Ireland; in Scotland in Lewis, North Uist, South Uist, Barra, Skye, Mull, Tiree, Eigg, Islay, Kintyre, Lorne, Wester Ross and unknown places in Argyll; in Cape Breton in Canada; and in the Irish language in Middlesex in England and in Washington in the USA.\n Note: Diarmaid, Gráinne, agus Ciuthach (Diarmaid, Gráinne, and Ciuthach), An Cluiche Fichille faoin gCrann Iúir (The Chess Game beneath the Yew Tree), and Bàs Dhiarmad (The Death of Diarmaid) also concern the elopement of Diarmaid and Gráinne and the death of Diarmaid.\n\n\n",

While they are away, Fionn’s wife, Maighnís, convinces Sadhbh, the wife of one of Fionn’s followers, to go swimming with the women of the Fianna. While Sadhbh is standing on shore, she sees a large, menacing ship approaching. The women are soon met by Ciotach Cruadh Armach, king of Drólluinn (often shortened to ‘Ciotach’ or similar variations). After a brief exchange with Maighnís, he abducts Sadhbh. Before they depart, Maighnís places a geis which prevents Ciotach or any other man from sleeping with the captured woman until a year and a day has passed. Maighnís informs Fionn of what has happened, and a contingent of the Fianna soon set out to rescue her.\n In most versions of the story, the rescue party stop at two islands along the way. In one telling from Donegal, the two countries are listed as Spain and France. Likewise, a regular feature of the tale has the son of one of the island kings accompanying the Fianna on their journey. When the group reach Drólluinn, Ciotach is away collecting his tributes from around the world. In his absence, the Fianna successfully rescue Sadhbh, and also manage to plunder the city and kill most of its inhabitants, including Ciotach’s whole family and all of his followers. In the standard tale, a small group of survivors inform Ciotach that the Fianna are responsible. In the oral versions from County Galway, a sole survivor of the conflict informs a highly distressed Ciotach what has occurred. He then vows revenge on the Fianna before setting off for Ireland.\n Upon landing in Ireland, Ciotach is received by the high king, Cormac mac Airt, who points him in the direction of Clan Baoiscne. Ciotach proceeds to overpower and tie up all of the members of Clan Baoiscne, save for Fionn and Oscar. After a prolonged standoff, Oscar defeats and beheads Ciotach, before untying his bound comrades. There is a slight variation in the tale’s ending in the County Galway versions, as the Fianna help themselves to the tributes still aboard the defeated Ciotach’s ship.",
